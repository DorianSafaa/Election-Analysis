# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to assist a Colorado board of elections employee to conduct an election audit of a Colorado Congressional precinct's tabulated results. We need to report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. There are three voting methods used in this election: Mail-In Ballot, Punch Cards, and Direct Recording Electronic. The votes cast by these three methods will determine the final election result. Finally, we need to generate a vote count report to certify this U.S. congressional race. 

## Purpose

Our purpose in this project is to find:

•	Total number of votes cast

•	A complete list of candidates who received votes

•	Total number of votes each candidate received

•	Percentage of votes each candidate won

•	The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources

•	Data Source: election_results.csv

•	Software: Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Results

The analysis of the election show that:

•	There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

•   Counties voters turnout:

     o  Jefferson had 10.5% of voters, for a total of 38,855 voters.
    
     o  Denver had 82.8% of voters, for a total of 306,055 voters.
    
     o  Arapahoe: had 6.7% of voters, for a total of 24,801 voters.

• Largest County Turnout: Denver

•	The candidates were:

    o	Charles Casper Stockham

    o	Diana DeGette

    o	Raymon Anthony Doane

•	The candidate results were:

    o	Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.

    o	Diana DeGette received 74% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

    o	Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.

 ## Summary
 
 In summary, the code used in this analysis helped us to find the total number of votes, the total number of votes for each candidate in in each county, the percentage of votes each candidate received and in each county and finally the winner candidate and the largest county turnout. The code can be easily adjausted to do analysis for different types of elections (Federal,etc.). Also, candidates can benefit from the analysis to find out how they do in every county. This can help them focus on some counties more than other based on the total votes they received.
