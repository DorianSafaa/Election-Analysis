# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to assist a Colorado board of elections employee to conduct an election audit of a Colorado Congressional precinct's tabulated results. We need to report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. There are three voting methods used in this election: Mail-In Ballot, Punch Cards, and Direct Recording Electronic. The votes cast by these three methods will determine the final election result. Finally, we need to generate a vote count report to certify this U.S. congressional race.
